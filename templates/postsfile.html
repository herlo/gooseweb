<span class="post_author">Clint Savage</span><h3>‘The Quest for the Golden GoOSe’ Sprint is here!</h3>2012-07-27T03:12:11+00:00<p>Alright folks, it&#8217;s been decided, determined and is about to be announced! Um, yeah, that&#8217;s right everyone, the &#8216;Quest for the Golden GoOSe&#8217; Sprint is on!</p>
<p>When is this happening you ask? Well it&#8217;s very simple and very soon, in fact it&#8217;s happening July 27-28, 2012. Yes, that&#8217;s Tomorrow and Saturday. It&#8217;s a bit unexpected for some of you, to be sure, but if you can make it, we&#8217;d love to have you for any time possible. If you can&#8217;t make it, take some time this next week and work on the GoOSe. The goal is to get the Golden GoOSe 6.0 release out by the end of August, so we really need to start cranking!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s left, you ask? Quite a bit actually, but the biggest piece still remaining is our Quality Assurance testing and reporting components. We&#8217;re working on them in our <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/qa">qa repository on github</a>, and you can most definitely fork it and get an idea of what we&#8217;re doing. We need some serious help with ABI compliance, validation of RPMS and overall validation that all packages have been built.</p>
<p>Wait! There&#8217;s more! We also need help with documentation, code and usability testing of the isos. The documentation is all based upon our<br />
<a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/main/wiki/how_to_cook_a_goose">&#8216;How to Cook a Goose&#8217; wiki page on github</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein">skein code</a> needs to be<br />
updated to the new <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">github v3 api</a> and the Isos can be <a href="http://get.gooseproject.org">downloaded and</a><br />
<a href="http://get.gooseproject.org"> tested</a>.</p>
<p>Some of this is more self-explanatory and some is just plain confusing. This is where we need your help! If you have ever wanted to define how things work, you can jump in now and help us identify things and help us solve problems. That&#8217;s the fun part about free and open source software! A good for instance, what is the usability testing requirements for our Isos? Well at the moment, we don&#8217;t really have a good handle on this, but you could step in and define some requirements. If you would prefer to help write code, you could clean up things that might look a bit messy. There&#8217;s plenty to do!</p>
<p>Please come and help us out this weekend or anytime next week! We&#8217;ll be in #gooseproject on irc.freenode.net, or you can work by <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/goose-linux">email</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/main/issues?labels=scrub+for+upstream+content&amp;state=open">github</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasensory_perception">ESP</a>. We&#8217;re excited to be moving forward and look for your help making the the &#8216;Quest for the Golden GoOSe&#8217; 6.0 release a reality!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>The first will be on my latest project, <a href="http://conference.utos.org/schedule/schedule-thursday/">GoOSe Linux &#8211; Rebuilding Enterprise Linux the &#8216;Community&#8217; Way</a> at 11:15am on Thursday, May 3.. If you ever wondered why CentOS took so long to rebuild Enterprise Linux, wondered what other options are out there, or even were just curious how Linux is built, come by and listen. It will be entertaining and enlightening.</p>
<p>The second talk will be <a href="http://conference.utos.org/schedule/schedule-thursday/">Koji &#8211; A Reliable, Repeatable Build Environment</a>, 4pm on Thursday, May 3. If you aren&#8217;t aware of what Koji does, it builds and manages RPMs. While we use it for the GoOSe project, many folks need a simple and clean way to build packages in a repeatable and reliable way.  Koji can also build LiveCD/LiveDVD images, manages repositories, tags builds and much, much more.</p>
<p>The last presentation I will be giving is &#8216;<a href="http://conference.utos.org/schedule/schedule-friday/">The State of Open Source</a>&#8216;, it&#8217;s a keynote presentation at 1:30pm on Friday, May 4. Expect this talk to be light and fun! I hope everyone comes out and enjoys this talk as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, it looks like Victor and the gang <a href="http://conference.utos.org/site-badges/">have created badges for you to put on your blog, Facebook, Google+, etc.</a> so get them out there and come hang out at UTOSC 2012!</p>

<address>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/goose-linux/browse_thread/thread/7f068af8b978ab52">original post is in the GoOSe mailing list</a>. I am reprinting here for a wider audience.</address>
<p>Last night, Mike (shalkie) and I had a nice discussion about the process we are now using to build / import packages. This is in preparation for now and the future. A lot of this discussion is thanks to Mathieu Bridon (bochecha).</p>
<p>I have inserted a few notes in the process below for clarification.</p>
<p>02:03 &lt; herlo&gt; k, so you should know that you first &#8216;skein request&#8217; a package<br />
02:03 &lt; herlo&gt; it can be done with either the &#8211;path or &#8211;name option, but one must be provided<br />
02:04 &lt; herlo&gt; normally, one shouldn&#8217;t grant their own package. I should be around some tomorrow to grant packages in bulk for you as needed<br />
02:04 &lt; herlo&gt; but<br />
02:04 &lt; herlo&gt; if you do need to grant a package<br />
02:04 &lt; herlo&gt; it should be something like<br />
02:05 &lt; herlo&gt; skein grant -k &lt;koji owner&gt; -g &lt;github owner&gt; issue_number name</p>
<p>Package repos and koji tags are what get created with skein grant. However *only* an admin can grant a new package into our build environment. This is to make sure we are not putting packages into the process that are not part of the upstream and/or for a good review<br />
process. In the future, I suspect quite a few people will be admins and this will be less problematic.</p>
<p>02:05 &lt; herlo&gt; once granted, the package can be imported with<br />
02:05 &lt; herlo&gt; skein import /path/to/srpm<br />
02:06 &lt; herlo&gt; usually though, I do take one extra manual step.<br />
02:06 &lt; herlo&gt; I visit the repo page on github and add a service hook<br />
02:06 &lt; herlo&gt; if you look at this page: <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=https://github.com/gooselinux/libgnomecanvasmm26/admin/hooks&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6KIv_Ic3KgYsKXQzFJx07YpJqXQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/gooselinux/libgnomecanvasmm26/admin/hooks</a><br />
02:07 &lt; herlo&gt; you can see the &#8216;Post-Receive URLs (1)&#8217;<br />
02:07 &lt; herlo&gt; if you click on it, you&#8217;ll see the url you should add for any new repo<br />
02:07 &lt; herlo&gt; this post receive hook will automatically launch builds upon a commit</p>
<p>If you have admin access to a repository (and if a package has been &#8216;granted&#8217; to you, then you do), add the following in the Post-Receive<br />
URLs if it&#8217;s not already there:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://roman.gooselinux.org:8080/add&amp;usg=AFQjCNEx42wY7S0qjsd8GMv39mKiAQ7NtA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://roman.gooselinux.org:8080/add</a></p>
<p>02:08 &lt; herlo&gt; once you have that in place, run the import command described above<br />
02:08 &lt; herlo&gt; at that point, everything should be pretty automatic.<br />
02:08 &lt; shalkie&gt; k<br />
02:08 &lt; herlo&gt; within 10 minutes, the build should automatically launch<br />
02:08 &lt; herlo&gt; shalkie: seem pretty straightforward?<br />
02:09 &lt; shalkie&gt; Yeah it does.<br />
02:09 &lt; herlo&gt; k, so now it should also be clear that you may (and probably already do) have failed builds<br />
02:09 &lt; shalkie&gt; The stack of email certainly suggests that.<br />
02:09 &lt; herlo&gt; lol<br />
02:10 &lt; herlo&gt; shalkie: a good portion of those can be run through again, though I have been working on fixing a few of mine<br />
02:10 &lt; herlo&gt; shalkie: as you look through the failed builds, you may just need to run them again<br />
02:11 &lt; herlo&gt; to do that, you can use<br />
02:11 &lt; herlo&gt; skein build<br />
02:11 &lt; herlo&gt; the way I usually do that is &#8216;skein build &#8211;nowait dist-gl6 &lt;pkg_name&gt;&#8217;<br />
02:11 &lt; herlo&gt; only an admin can perform this task (you are an admin)<br />
02:12 &lt; herlo&gt; you can watch the tasks at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://koji.gooselinux.org/koji&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQ6JLQcbMJv5RSM8aVacSil6xUVg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://koji.gooselinux.org/koji</a> as you always have, or go out for a<br />
few hours and check the build statuses when you return</p>
<p>02:13 &lt; herlo&gt; BUT WAIT! There&#8217;s more!<br />
02:13 &lt; herlo&gt; If for some reason, you determine something has to change in the spec file, like another dependency or something<br />
02:13 &lt; herlo&gt; you&#8217;ll need to do two things<br />
02:14 &lt; herlo&gt; first, clone the branch if not already there and then create a vanilla branch<br />
02:16 &lt; herlo&gt; git checkout &#8211;track -b  &lt;local branch&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;tracked branch&gt;<br />
02:16 &lt; herlo&gt; eg git checkout &#8211;track -b vanilla origin/vanilla<br />
02:16 &lt; herlo&gt; then push that vanilla branch<br />
02:16 &lt; herlo&gt; git push origin vanilla<br />
02:17 &lt; herlo&gt; this is so we can keep the original state of the package before we make any changes. I&#8217;ll be working on  automating this later<br />
02:17 &lt; herlo&gt; when vanilla is pushed, we&#8217;ll go back to master and make our changes<br />
02:17 &lt; herlo&gt; git checkout master<br />
02:17 &lt; herlo&gt; &lt;make changes&gt;<br />
02:17 &lt; herlo&gt; git add &lt;files changed&gt;<br />
02:17 &lt; herlo&gt; git commit -m &#8220;message regarding changes&#8221;<br />
02:18 &lt; herlo&gt; git push origin master<br />
02:18 &lt; herlo&gt; again, when you push to master, a build will be launched within 10 minutes<br />
02:18 &lt; herlo&gt; sit back, enjoy coffee and wait for the build to return</p>
<p>At the moment, the &#8216;master&#8217; branch is currently what is getting built. Vanilla never gets built, but serves as a reference point to what the upstream did at certain points along the way. The vanilla branch also provides a way to merge in upstream changes with our changes. Git will<br />
make this easy for us, because merge conflicts will be much easier to resolve across branches.</p>
<p>I hope this little conversation is a bit clearer on the process we&#8217;re trying to use. Look for further improvements coming to skein 2.1 (I already have quite the feature list) in the next few months.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Clint</p>
<p>PS &#8211; I likely won&#8217;t be online when this post is published as I&#8217;ll literally be enjoying some GoOSe, prepared by my lovely wife. She is an amazing cook / chef and is attempting this for the first time ever!</p>

<p>As of this <a href="http://sexysexypenguins.com/misc/goose_failed_builds20111221.txt">morning</a>, it appears we only have around 40 failed builds! We&#8217;re getting very close!

You can always find the canonical copy <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/main/blob/master/brainstorm/collaboration.rst">here.</a></p>

<p>The GoOSe Project is only one of the upstream enterprise Linux rebuild projects. We are excited to work together with others in the EL rebuild space, and feel that there is plenty of room for separate but collaborative communities. The similarities in our goals should work for our mutual benefit. And the differences which exist should only strengthen us all.</p>

<p>So we need to answer this question:</p>

<p>In what can we collaborate?</p>

<p>What follows are the results of a pretty free-form brainstorming session we had at one of the GoOSe Project's weekly meetings.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shared infrastructure</p>

<p>Sharing certain pieces of infrastructure makes a lot of sense.</p>

<ul>
<li>Upstream Sources Mirroring -- Although there are various places that one can find the upstream sources having another collaborative mirror for the various rebuild projects could be beneficial.</li>
<li>Cross Project Backups -- Doing backups is difficult, if we spread out the load of backing up our repositories, scripts, look aside caches, configuration files we could restore in the case of a catastrophic failure</li>
<li>Project Mirroring -- Distributing the final product of our efforts can be daunting as well. Again, being willing to mirror the ISOs or packages of the other projects will help make all the products better accessible.</li>
<li>Help Building and Configuring Non-Shared Infrastructure -- Most of these projects are using the same or similar tools, Koji for example. Working together on setting up these systems will help reduce the amount of constitutional knowledge(better phrase here?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>QA help</p>

<ul>
<li>Building QA Test Suites -- Due to the common ancestor of these projects, a common set of test cases could be useful. This should be extensible/fork able for the test cases which would be specific to a certain project.</li>
<li>Cross-QA Checks -- A very good way of testing if something is correct is having someone else run the same test as you. Sharing the QA work and results would reduce the need for everyone to figure things like this out for themselves. I think the best example of this would be the information needed to verify ABI compatibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p>

<p>Of the many places where EL rebuild projects can easily collaborate, the best return of investment is sure to come from the documentation side. Again the common ancestor of these distribution works in our favor. There is a great need for documentation and how-to's. Sadly most good documentation is out of date. Thus a collaborative documentation effort would help lighten the load and keep things better up to date.</p>

<p>Other documentation-like ideas include common wikis, a common askbot-style system, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribution Creation Information</p>

<p>The main product of all these different projects is a Linux distribution. Sharing the problems and various solutions to compile and create this product helps to make the entire community better. Things to share include:</p>

<ul>
<li>package build order</li>
<li>package meta data</li>
<li>package content signatures</li>
<li>ABI compliance information</li>
<li>upstream trademark issues/problems</li>
<li>missing build dependencies</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Community Enhancements</p>

<p>As the number one goal of the GoOSe project is to build the community, we spend a lot of time thinking about the ways to enhance the <em>ENTIRE</em> community ecosystem. We plan on sharing what we learn for best practices for:</p>

<ul>
<li>community management</li>
<li>meetings </li>
<li>organizational structure</li>
<li>updates to your community about your progress</li>
</ul>

<p>We also plan on working on spreading the word about our community goals. Some tools to help us accomplish this include:</p>

<ul>
<li>EL Rebuild Planet -- Would others be interested in joining this?</li>
<li>Social Networking -- Twitter, Identica, Facebook, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><p>We also want to practice what we preach about making this truly a community based idea. Please <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/main/blob/master/brainstorm/collaboration.rst">fork and update</a> this document to help improve it.</p></p></li>
</ul>
With a stronger community around our projects we can all have a better time accomplishing our goals. And hopefully making the world a little bit better than we found it :).

The GoOSe Project results are looking good.</p>
<h3>Build statistics from 2011-11-01 through 2011-12-09</h3>
<address>Completed Builds: 658<br />
Failed Builds: 296</address>
<p>It appears that a bit more than 1/3 of the builds failed and notifications are going out to the package owners. This means we can work through each of them and resubmit them. Odds are that most of them are due to dependency issues and only a few for other reasons.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re preparing for <strong>Pass #2</strong> this weekend. We&#8217;ve discovered some interesting things, however, so here&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll be putting in place first (hopefully):</p>
<h3>A repository to track BANNED and EXCLUDED (for now, other names may arise) SRPMs.</h3>
<p>At the moment, there are SRPMs we cannot build because we don&#8217;t support an architecture (s390, for example) There is no reason to build packages that won&#8217;t work. There are also some packages that contain proprietary content we need to scrub, even though the license states they are free software. These packages will have to wait unless they affect a critical path of getting GoOSe 6.0 composed in coming weeks.</p>
<p>The plan here is to create a repository to track these banned / excluded SRPMs. Skein will query this git repository for the BANNED and EXCLUDED files to make sure any request, grant, or build actions first check to make sure the package is not in either list. If the package is in the list, skein will refuse to act upon the package and the requester will have to resolve the issue before attempting again.</p>
<p>Watch for the updated skein v2.1 with this fix in place in the very near future.</p>

This evening, after dinner, I will be releasing <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein/tree/master">skein 2.0</a>. It&#8217;s major functionality will be documented and placed in the <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein/blob/master/RELEASE.rst">RELEASE.rst</a> file on github. Essentially, the request, query, grant, import and build functionality is what makes this <strong>2.0</strong> and ready to use.</p>
<p>The best part about this tool is, while I have been working on it, almost all of the remaining SRPMS have been imported and the majority of them have been built on our koji server. Right now, we&#8217;re on the <a href="http://koji.gooselinux.org/koji/tasks?start=300&amp;state=all&amp;view=tree&amp;method=all&amp;order=-id">last batch</a> and I expect it to finish sometime late Friday or early Saturday (12/10/2011). This ends our first major hurdle to getting an Alpha release of GoOSe Linux 6.0 out the door.</p>
<p>Another huge tool in this process is <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/grapple">Grapple</a>, written by <a href="http://the.softwaretoolsmith.com">python master Nafai</a>, (aka Travis Hartwell). He spent a good bit of time getting this <a href="http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/">github hook</a> in place that will record all git commits and help to process them automatically. I spent a bit of time and added a client script to grab the recorded commits and send them on to koji automatically with the proper dist value and url. No more guessing! This is the &#8216;automagic&#8217; corollary to skein build.</p>
<p>Next up, I plan to rebuild the <a href="http://koji.gooselinux.org/koji/buildsbystatus">failed builds</a> and push them through koji again, using skein build. Possibly doing this a few more times until we get things pared down to the packages that don&#8217;t just have dependency problems. I hope to have most of those fixed up and in place by Monday or Tuesday next week (12/12/2011).I&#8217;ve also noticed a few builds that will never build for our arches, so I will have to figure out what to do with them for now.  I don&#8217;t want to waste koji resources trying to rebuild them when I know they will never work.</p>
<p>The first Alpha ISO is getting close enough to taste it now! We&#8217;ll have to make sure to have a grand celebration upon our first Golden GoOSe Release :)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Unfortunately it appears more and more that I, and most of the GoOSe project people in Utah, won&#8217;t be able to attend. In scratching our heads over the process we think we have an interesting plan: We are thinking about setting up a virtual presentation.</p>
<p><span id="more-161"></span>So we have been looking around at various solutions. We haven&#8217;t presented this option to the user group yet but if this works then we might keep this method in our back pocket for future presentation. It could be a very useful thing, we might be able to repeat this for other user groups around the country or even world.</p>
<p>So far we have looked at Google+ hangouts. I think there might be some better solutions out there at the moment though.</p>
<p>To make this work the presentation tool should allow the presenters to provide visual and audio data. It should also allow for the presentation of the slides and ideally a few real life examples of doing things like submitting packages for repos and submitting packages to the GoOSe koji server(s).</p>
<p>The presentation solution should allow the use of Linux systems (Yeah, we all probably run Linux as our primary operating system) and work over relatively low bandwidth, since most of the time presenters may be using a congested hotel wifi service.</p>
<p>I find this to be an intriguing and potentially useful project.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will find a good solution soon!</p>

<p>As I have been working on getting the import functionality into <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein/tree/new_workflow">skein pre2.0</a>, there are a few features that have come to mind as I go along. It&#8217;s very interesting to see these features appear once the tool is out in the wild. Some of them have come from other users/contributors and some from my brain, but here&#8217;s a dump of what I have been considering adding to skein:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein/issues/7">skein revoke</a> &#8211; (this one is from imak, and quite a good idea) It&#8217;s possible to accidentally request a repo that you didn&#8217;t mean to request. skein revoke will allow you to specify that you erred and will allow you to close the request with a nice message you provide.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein/issues/8">skein request from an SRPM</a> &#8211; the above request brought forth something I&#8217;d been thinking about doing, but hadn&#8217;t really formalized. I suspect this feature will be a good bit of our automation in our second push to finish GoOSe 6.0 by year&#8217;s end.</li>
<li>skein update &#8211; providing this feature will probably happen <strong>after</strong> 2.0. The plan would be to allow an already existing repo to be updated to a new release or version of an SRPM. In addition, it&#8217;s possible the update will be to a new branch, which update should be able to handle.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the rest of the features, the code for export was just finished today. I expect to be able to finish push, upload and import by the end of this coming week. Then it will be on to importing the rest of the upstream tree and building GoOSe 6.0</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Herlo</p>http://sexysexypenguins.com/2011/11/20/goose-and-skein-the-road-to-2-0/<span class="post_author">Clint Savage</span><h3>GoOSe Project: Progress toward Skein 2.0</h3>2011-11-10T23:34:35+00:00<p>As some of you may already know, I&#8217;ve been a part of this <a href="http://gooseproject.org">enterprise rebuild project</a> for a while now and things have been going pretty well. Recently, though, I&#8217;ve made some good progress on our import and build tool, <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein">skein</a>.</p>
<p>Skein&#8217;s goal is provide easy functionality for rebuilding SRPMS from upstream and import them into github, where they can be built using our <a href="http://koji.gooselinux.org">koji instance</a>. The process is actually easier than one might think:</p>
<ul>
<li>skein request &#8211; Request a particular repository be setup on our github organization for the specified package. The package itself should be able to be requested from the SRPM, but that feature is not yet available.</li>
<li>skein query &#8211; To verify the request has been placed, this shows the open queries (by default).</li>
<li>skein show &#8211; For a particular request, show the detail of who requested and the purpose of such a request.</li>
<li>skein grant &#8211; Only an admin can grant the repository. Only members of the admin team on our github organization can grant the repository.</li>
<li>skein extract &#8211; Once granted, the SRPM can be extracted and placed into two basic directories:</li>
<ul>
<li>/path/to/package/lookaside/ &#8211; contains the archive from the SRPM, usually a tar, tar.gz or zip file. The contents of this directory can then be pushed to the lookaside cache.</li>
<li>/path/to/package/git/ &#8211; contains the spec file, any patches and other sources that are not archives. A Makefile and sources file are also generated along with a .gitignore to provide useful functionality during the koji build</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Other functionality is currently under development:</p>
<ul>
<li>skein push &#8211; Once extracted and committed to the git repository, this pushes the git commits to github.</li>
<li>skein upload &#8211; Once extracted, this uploads the content of the lookaside directory to the lookaside cache at pkgs.gooselinux.org.</li>
<li>skein import &#8211; A combination of skein extract, push and upload, since that seems fairly logical.</li>
<li>skein build &#8211; Albeit mostly complete, it will need to be tested with an SRPM that has been run through this process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I took a few minutes the other day and created a video of the completed process. I post this here for others to use for their benefit, but also so I can have it in another place besides my laptop.</p>

It started with a very polite email to the GoOSe mailing list from Andrew Cutler. Shortly afterwards, over the course of a couple weeks, a few people stopped in to #gooseproject and expressed interest in possibly merging the two projects.</p>
<p>The GoOSe project has promised a response and it is the main topic of conversation for this evenings meeting.<br />
<span id="more-146"></span>Though I think they [Ascendos] may be thinking of the GoOSe project merging into Ascendos and not the other way around.</p>
<p>So the question becomes when do two projects that appear to be very similar merge? What criteria should be considered in the process and when do projects that are similar stand aside?</p>
<p>Warning: I won&#8217;t express my opinion on the proposed merger itself in this posting.</p>
<h2>Consider the possibilities&#8230;</h2>
<p>There once was a boy/girl/other project that seemed an awful lot like another boy/girl/other project. They seemed so similar that people sometimes confused the two. And like other couples people began to whisper about the two becoming one. Now if this was a discussion of relationships between two people everyone would agree that it gets more complicated then that. Accordingly when you talk about open and free software projects there are usually several people involved and complexity can grow.</p>
<p>So lets start with the basic question, why merge at all?</p>
<ul>
<li>Merging should create a much cooler and better project!</li>
<li>Combining the the resources of both groups and at the same time removing duplicated work.</li>
<li>Resources and tasks become consolidated.</li>
<li>Eliminate confusion and the &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between x, y and z?&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>When projects consider merging they should also consider some of the less pleasant things that might happen. Why shouldn&#8217;t projects in merge?</p>
<ul>
<li>When you merge projects some people are going to be lost. There may not be any hard feelings but the project, work flow, objectives, and people involved will shift in such a way that members may no longer want be involved. In some cases this may actually result in a new competing project being started by disaffected members.</li>
<li>Loss of diversity. Competing projects help bring out the best for both projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what if two projects have proposed a merger and decide against merging, what will the outcome be?</p>
<h2>Only the shadow knows!</h2>
<p>Things can change drastically from one project to another in the space of months, weeks or even days. It seems that a lot of projects tend to pick up a competitor and in the end only one survives. Of course to simply say that there is room for only one Linux distribution is silly. Distrowatch tracks hundreds of active distributions. Though there are only a few top projects that get most of the work. As the independent projects progress contributors will almost inevitably decide what project they want to be with. While this doesn&#8217;t necessarily doom either one of the projects it certainly can lead to a lopsided effect.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Ubuntu, SUSE and Red Hat. I don&#8217;t think anyone would argue that Red Hat has the largest footprint in enterprise and user base. But that doesn&#8217;t mean SUSE and Ubuntu are unused or even inconsiderable in their footprint. While Red Hat is bigger it doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t considerable contributions or even cooperation with the other two.</p>
<p>So projects can survive in a competitive situation and potentially survive very well. On the other end of the spectrum projects that get overshadowed may not have the interest or man power to continue with their project. The Open Source and Free Software landscape is littered with the decays of really cool projects that never gained enough traction to continue.</p>
<p>Sometimes moving forward as an independent project just means putting the merger process off for a while and merging later down the road. Sometimes it means that you try to get a merger only to find that the other party no longer has an interest in a merger but will take new contributions and contributors.</p>
<h2>Conclusion?</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t have one beyond this: Merging two communities is a tricky business and has long term consequences. It is not a trivial item to undertake.</p>
<p>For the boy/girl/other and boy/girl/other discussed earlier, perhaps it is a good thing to just be friends for the time being. Divorces suck.</p>

If you haven&#8217;t heard about this project, check out my <a href="http://sexysexypenguins.com/2011/09/26/building-rpms-and-twif-interview/">previous</a> <a href="http://sexysexypenguins.com/2011/09/19/building-an-os-the-workflow/">posts</a>.</address>
<p>Well, I have been meaning to write this post every day this week, only to be bombarded with work or other projects getting in the way. However, I am currently sitting at the <a href="http://beansandbrews.com">Beans &amp; Brews</a> <a href="http://www.beansandbrews.com/locations.html">at 45 East 11400 South in Sandy, Utah</a> participating in the <a href="http://theadamsresidence.net/2011/10/21/goose-sprint/">very first GoOSe Sprint</a>.</p>
<p>My goal today is very simple, get <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein">skein</a> 2.0 out the door for testing. Most of contributors will be using skein to build the upstream packages necessary to make the distribution work, so I need to finish this work.</p>
<p>There are other tasks being performed today, including documentation, package building, automating tasks and finishing up the <a href="http://gooseproject.github.com">new website</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in seeing how an enterprise quality distribution can be rebuilt using free software, we&#8217;d love to have you stop by #gooseproject on <a href="http://irc.freenode.net">irc.freenode.net</a>. The <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/goose-linux">GoOSe mailing list</a> is another great place to read about what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Or if you like physical space, come on by the Beans &amp; Brews today from 10am until 2pm. There should be at least a few of us working on something all day long. Just look for the nerds in the corner getting all excited while discussing phrases like &#8216;build process&#8217; and &#8216;skein grant&#8217; :P</p>
<p><strong>Update: We&#8217;re going to be moving down to the Beans and Brews at 155 East 13800 South at approximately 12:45pm</strong></p>

<span id="more-115"></span><br />
<h2>The EL words</h2>
<p>I have been using Linux off and on for a number of years (It is actually coming close to 20!) and have seen it mature over those years. I have also used various Free and Open Source operating systems as well as proprietary systems. One of the the most remarkable things has been to see the widespread adoption of Linux in the Enterprise space.</p>
<p>I believe that Linux could have happily remained as a hobbyist dream and enjoyed a long life of fruitful innovation. Of course this is idle speculation that has in many ways past us by.</p>
<p>As companies begin to adopt products they have certain expectations for the products they employ, regardless of the associated cost. In some ways they have greater flexibility than the home hobbyist since they have coffers to reach in and pay for more stable and reliable systems. While offering money helps motivate further production and development of systems, is a great means of advancing systems and attracting developers, it doesn&#8217;t solve everything. Investment of money does tend to set higher expectations.</p>
<p>Some of the higher expectations that are set with adoption of a system in the enterprise are things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Timely and Productive Bug Resolution</li>
<li>Proactive Development</li>
<li>Regular Updates</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been a number of Linux Distributions over the years that have all strived for these goals. Some of them more productively then others.</p>
<p>The current crop of Enterprise level distributions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</li>
<li>Oracle Enterprise Linux</li>
<li>SUSE Enterprise Linux</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>CentOS</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there are others but those are the most common ones that I hear of working with people from enterprise environments.</p>
<h2>Give and Ye Shall Receive</h2>
<p>Of the previously listed distributions both Oracle Enterprise Linux and CentOS are based upon Red Hat Enterprise Linux. While they may be the most prominent they are most certainly not the only ones.</p>
<p>Why has one distribution become so popular and been rebuilt by so many?</p>
<p>We could look at the market share and assume that it is simply a matter of dominance in the market place. It might be the fruits of  long and hard efforts to promote their brand and create an effective training and certification process.</p>
<p>I suspect that all of these items play a varying roles in the &#8220;success&#8221; of Red Hat and the RHEL clones. I also think that one of the big differences is how readily accessible the source code is for the users. You may have noticed that there isn&#8217;t a rebuild of the SUSE system running around out there.</p>
<p>Red Hat is a very open company and publishes source code to a publicly available ftp site where anyone can grab the source RPM packages.</p>
<h2>What did they ever do for you?</h2>
<p>Red Hat is a very different company in this sense. There have been a few packages that they haven&#8217;t released the source code for, or have taken their time (i.e. RHN Satellite Server released as Spacewalk), but they don&#8217;t restrict access to updates in source code form. It is very possible for you to get the demo version of RHEL and keep it up to date by building your own updated RPMs wth the source RPMs from the ftp site.</p>
<p>These packages are available and people can rebuild these packages and come up with a rebuild of a RHEL system from Tip to Tail. And the world has certainly done it. The number of systems out there that do a rebuild of RHEL is pretty impressive and they keep coming.</p>
<p>But what does this do for Red Hat?</p>
<p>Its a gateway into their support and contract services. They know that once they gain a foothold into your enterprise they will have an ongoing customer. Even if their potential customer is using something other then actual RHEL they will eventually join the fold.</p>
<p>From the perspective of RHEL this is a good long term strategy. They are essentially giving away their product, even when it is a rebuild, that will get their foot in the door.</p>
<p>There may not be a need for support for your print server but there will be for your data center.</p>
<p>So as discussed Red Hat has good reason to let rebuilds be encouraged. There is also the fact that good rebuild projects feed back through bug reports and help improve their product.</p>
<h2>Let the Rebuilds Begin!</h2>
<p>Since there are good reasons for Red Hat to be accommodating of rebuilds, why not just one? Why doesn&#8217;t everyone just work on a single project?</p>
<p>Many of the rebuilds have focused on rebuilding for a particular reason. Each has adopted a different model for its administration. While these projects all rebuild Red Hat they can be very different under the covers.</p>
<p>While I have been a big supporter of CentOS in the past, recent events have brought to light the underlying administrative model of CentOS. Following these events there were questions and unhappy answers.</p>
<p>During this unhappy period there was a moment of reflection. A lot of users were unhappy with the delay that it took to get to CentOS 6. The reaction from the CentOS builders and their supports was along the lines of &#8220;You will get it when you get it and if you want it faster build it yourself.&#8221;.</p>
<p>Towards the ends of the 200+ day wait that it took to build CentOS 6 many people, including myself, began to wonder if there wasn&#8217;t a different approach that could be taken.</p>
<h2>Enter the GoOSe</h2>
<p>GoOSe Enterprise Linux isn&#8217;t much different from CentOS in the ultimate product. It will be a rebuild of RHEL and the updates that are released. While almost the same there are some key differences.</p>
<p>The community is probably one of the biggest of the differences. Where CentOS has a small group of builders (6 the last time I checked) that are responsible for building and producing the product, GoOSe is very community oriented. From day one GoOSe has worked to build a meritocracy amongst its users.</p>
<p>GoOSe is meant to be built by the community for the community.</p>
<p>For those that want to be involved in building packages for release there is a path established and helping hands to guide users from an initial contributor to being one of the system builders. As the number of builders grow there is going to be a reduced lag in build time. It also &#8220;debusifies&#8221; the project.</p>
<p>Debusification is the process of removing reliance on a single or small group of individuals.</p>
<p>Another big difference is that GoOSe wants to be reproducible. You should be able to take the tools and the knowledge provided and rebuild GoOSe or even RHEL, using the provided tools. There is no interest in hiding the build process. Even the build tools that have been created for the project are available for updates and modification.</p>
<p>While GoOSe is still in the early stages it has some great potential.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.friocorte.com/2011/04/bootstrapping-a-rhel-clone.html">Recently I blogged</a> about how some friends and I were talking about what it would take to rebuild an enterprise Linux project. We started researching what we would need and we got started. The result? The <a href="http://www.gooseproject.org/">GoOSe Project.</a></p>

<p>What is the GoOSe project? It is a community rebuild of an <a href="http://redhat.com/">enterprise Linux distribution</a> based in the USA. But it is also more than that. The GoOSe project is more importantly a practice in building an Open Source community. We wanted to practice what we preach about how best to build a community. It just so happens that the product that this practice produces is a Linux distro.</p>

<h1>Why "GoOSe"?</h1>

<p>The name of the project was just a bit of riffing done on <a href="http://ibot.rikers.org/%23utos/20110412.html.gz">IRC</a>(look around 20:03.38). We have quite a bit done as far as getting things rebuilt and have some ideas as to how we want to run this community. We have an <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/gooseproject-main/wiki/gooseproject_ethos">ethos</a>. A <a href="http://koji.gooselinux.org/koji/">Koji instance</a> running our builds. And we are just about done with the Buildroot needed to make a fully functional system bootstrap.</p>

<p>The GoOSe project is "in progress" to getting the first build out. We are currently just about done with the first step which is to compile all the upstream packages into a buildroot we can use to compile our packages. A more detailed status update will be blogged about later.</p>

<h1>Why another rebuild project?</h1>

<p>As I mentioned above, <a href="http://blog.friocorte.com/2011/09/step-0-build-a-community.html">community is the hard part.</a> And although there are various other projects similar to ours, we think we can fill a certain niche. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://centos.org/">centOS</a> project for example is probably the biggest rebuild project out there and it caters to those who are looking for a 100% drop-in replacement for the upstream Linux distribution.  <a href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/">Scientific Linux</a> is built as a base for supporting computing clusters and experiments.</p>

<p>The GoOSe project is not out to replace or out-do any of these projects. We are here to build a community of passionate folks to build the best community-based enterprise operating system around. We will be sharing everything that we learn, everything we modify, and everything we build to help use create this distribution.  We all benefit from an improved community structure. We also benefit from having more than one project meeting different goals/niches. The things we learn also help all the other projects out there to have a well functioning system themselves.</p>

<h1>GoOSe Goals</h1>

<p>Our goal with building the GoOSe project is to have a cool community built around an easily constructed set of enterprise-grade software. The technical pieces of the equation taking the hard part out of building an enterprise operating system. <a href="http://sexysexypenguins.com/">Herlo</a> said it best when he said this with regard to the vision of the project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"[I see the GoOSe project as a] group of friends hanging out, building cool things with an enterprise-ready technology. Not exclusive to building the technology itself."</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Come help us</h1>

<p>We're already working away on these goals. You can come and help us. Here are some resources to get you started:</p>

    <img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoozbachsTechTips-gooseproject-atom/~4/_Hf8F7INV3g" width="1" />http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoozbachsTechTips-gooseproject-atom/~3/_Hf8F7INV3g/introducing-the-goose-project.html<span class="post_author">Clint Savage</span><h3>Building an OS: The workflow!</h3>2011-09-20T00:24:37+00:00<p>Over the past few months, I&#8217;ve been working on a project which has inspired me to think about how a complete Operating System is built from the ground up. Luckily for me, this process is pretty well documented by the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ReleaseEngineering/Overview">Fedora Project</a>.</p>
<p>The project I&#8217;ve been working on does require a bit of thought around enterprise Linux versions run by a community. There is the ever amazing <a href="http://centos.org">CentOS</a>, <a href="http://scientificlinux.org">Scientific Linux</a> and a few others who have been around the block a time or two. The work that they have done has been immense and very helpful to many, including me.</p>
<p>For my project, the work was about building a fully binary compatible, enterprise-ready, community version of Linux, very similar to what CentOS and others have done. The question always comes &#8216;why?&#8217; which will be addressed later on in future posts. Suffice it to say, the work we&#8217;ve been doing has paid off in both a individual and community sense.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this project, it was clear that we needed some tools to make things work the way we wanted. Luckily, there were tools out there to do a good portion of our work. Tools like <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji"><strong>koji</strong></a>, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock"><strong>mock</strong></a> and of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"><strong>Linux</strong></a> to bring it all together. But other tools seemed to be missing and I went on a quest&#8230;</p>
<p>The first tool that seemed to be missing was a way to import src.rpms from the most popular upstream vendor. These packages needed to be rebuilt by koji in some fashion, but just taking the srpms and rebuilding them had been done before, and seems to be the preferred way to date. In my mind however, it seemed that we were missing a step. Enter <a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein"><strong>skein</strong></a>.</p>
<p>While skein is still very green and will need quite a bit more work, it accomplishes the goal of extracting the srpms into two parts. This tool basically sets up two things; a git repository on <a href="https://github.com/organizations/gooseproject">github.com</a> (for now) along with a location and verifiable way to store the archive stored inside the srpm, called a lookaside cache. If one looks at the way the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_Fedora_GIT">Fedora Project maintains their source</a>, this process is very similar.</p>
<p>Once the srpm is imported with skein, it can be built with koji. At the moment, this process is fairly manual, but the plan is to improve skein to also allow building from the repositories. However, another bit more automatic way to build would be to use a git hook. Luckily, github provides <a href="http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/">several ways to accomplish this</a>, including a custom URL to which an HTTP POST can be sent. At which time, koji would download the spec file and source from the appropriate locations and build a srpm.</p>
<p>Koji completes its task by building the binary RPM(s) and appropriately tagging the successful builds. Once complete, mash can be used to generate custom repositories to prepare for composing actual iso images. Mash is a command-line tool, again used by Fedora.</p>
<p>Once the repositories are generated by mash, <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/pungi/"><strong>pungi</strong></a> takes over. The process of building an iso is actually very simple, just a kickstart file, some repositories and pungi are used to create a fully installable DVD or multi-CD iso image.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of my <strong>excellent artwork</strong> to better describe the process.</p>
<p><a href="http://sexysexypenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/goose-workflow_800x600.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-950" height="360" src="http://sexysexypenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/goose-workflow_800x600.jpg" title="OS Workflow" width="480" /></a>A couple things to note about this process is that while it is starting to become clear how to build an OS from an upstream vendor, there are parts that still haven&#8217;t been addressed. Currently, we can import with skein and rebuild the SRPM and build the binary RPMs with koji. We yet to have enough binary RPMs to actually construct a buildroot, but we are getting very close.</p>
<p>Automating the builds with git hooks and a skein build process is a nice big step toward making our own Operating System possible.</p>
<p>The other big piece of the puzzle is dependency resolution. Now this has been mostly resolved by tools and apis like <a href="http://yum.baseurl.org/">Yum</a> and <a href="http://rpm5.org/">RPM</a>, but I still feel very much like a n00b when working with them. My hope is to figure out that process in the next week or so, and update skein to make building faster and easier overall.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

Over the course of the next few weeks, I'll be posting information on the build process.  We are using koji for our build infrastructure, which has actually been fairly beneficial for the professional work I've been doing lately. It turns out that plenty of organizations build and manage their own software in rpm form and need it to integrate with EL or other rpm-based linux distro's. So far, koji is the best system for making these custom packages work well with EL, in my opinion.  And now, back to building more pkgs.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5265800853438914661-4427967017262178645?l=www.sparsebrain.com" width="1" /></div>http://www.sparsebrain.com/2011/09/goose-project.html<span class="post_author">Derek Carter</span><h3>Step 0 -- Build a Community</h3>2011-09-12T14:37:54+00:00<p>In a recent <a href="http://blog.friocorte.com/2011/04/bootstrapping-a-rhel-clone.html">blogpost</a> I discussed what would be needed to start a rebuild project based on sources provided by a prominent Linux distribution.</p>

<p>Some friends and I started working towards this goal. We quickly determined that as interesting and difficult the technical problems and hardware needs for such a venture are, they are surprisingly the easy part. Much more difficult is the task of building a community.</p>

<h2>Community is Key</h2>

<p>The key to any vibrant Open Source project is the community behind the project. Without a living, breathing community, any project is doomed to end up dead.</p>

<p>Analyzing other Open Source projects out there I discovered there are two distinct communities involved with any &#8220;successful&#8221; project. The contributor community and the user community. And yes one is a sub-set of the other (or ideally would be). These two communities are symbiotic as well.</p>

<h2>Contributor Community</h2>

<p>The contributor community is the core of a project. It consists of volunteers working on task relating to the creation, improvement, and release of a project. Without the contributor community the project could not exist. This isn&#8217;t to say the contributor community works in a vacuum. The contributor community relies on the user community for a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First and foremost: Validation. Working on an Open Source project is a labor of love. Volunteers give a great deal of their time, talent, and work to an Open Source project. A vibrant user community validates the work of the contributors.</p></li>
<li><p>Second: User base. A project without users is a business without customers. No users; no project. The more users a project has the more willing contributors will be to work on the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Third: Feedback. There&#8217;s an old maxim: &#8220;Many hands make light work.&#8221; The Open Source equivalent to this is &#8220;Under many eyes, all bugs are shallow&#8221;. The larger the install base, the more likely quality bug reports will be generated and problems will be found and fixed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>User Community</h2>

<p>The other half of the project exists in the user community. The user community consists of those who download, install and use the project in their daily work. The user community depends on the contributor community for few things as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Number one: A Quality Product. People are using large Open Source projects in the core infrastructure of their businesses. A quality product makes this possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Second: Transparency. Given the importance of a quality product. Users are eager for updates. These can be either security updates, new features, new releases, or just &#8220;we&#8217;re working on these problems&#8221;. When you develop your project &#8220;in the dark&#8221; users will start to get leery. If you miss big releases regularly they start to loose confidence. Fear of a dying project can lead users to find alternatives or to fork the project themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally: Permanence. The user community depends on the contributor community for permanence. Open Source projects are living things and require constant care and feeding. They have their own life cycle. Open Source projects are created by volunteer forces. Those volunteers&#8217; priorities change, they move on &#8212; for whatever reason. A completely open development model helps overcome these speed bumps that can affect a project. Some recent events come to mind with regard to the movement of a community:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenIndiana#Relation_to_Solaris.2C_Solaris_Express.2C_Illumos">OpenSolaris/Solaris to OpenIndinana/Nexenta</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org#LibreOffice">OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice to Apache open office</a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Another item to think about is reducing the &#8220;bus factor&#8221;. The access to the entire project should not be limited to one member or small group of members of the contributor community. It should be available to all of the core trusted team. See <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/21921/CentOS_Project_Administrator_Goes_Missing-in-Action">CentOS Project Administrator Goes Missing</a>.</p>

<p>The ultimate answer to all of these concerns is to make the entire project <em>VERY</em> easy to fork. Using new distributed SCM tools makes this pretty easy. The ideal Open Source project should be able to be completely forked in a weekend at the longest.</p>

<h2>Community Trust</h2>

<p>When the user community and contributor community trust each other, things really start to happen. More contributors show up to help as they feel valued and want to participate. The stronger contributor community means a higher quality, better trusted project. The higher quality project then attracts more users and the feedback cycle grows. The output of this feedback cycle is better support, and a better product.</p>

<h2>Attracting Contributors</h2>

<p>After defining what the communities are and what they want, let&#8217;s talk about how to attract more people to both. To attract people to the contributor community you have to have a very low barrier of entry for contributions. I&#8217;ve found one of the easiest ways to do this is with a tool which allows for easy contributions. One such tool is <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. The manner in which you contribute to a project on GitHub is easy:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fork the repository</p></li>
<li><p>Make changes in your fork, and push the changes back to GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>Send a pull-request.</p></li>
<li><p>The upstream project will accept or reject your change set.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This low barrier of entry for a contributor also works as a great apprentice method. As people show their competency through things like these pull requests, they can easily be apprenticed into the core group of contributors. This makes your project a true meritocracy.  This apprentice system balances access with trust, and gives a clearly defined path from user to contributor.</p>

<p>In order for this apprentice system to work you need to have a list of todo items. Ideally this list would be full of low-hanging fruit for apprentice contributors. Things such as improving documentation, or adding an additional feature or simple bugfixes are good examples.</p>

<p>Advertising the hard problems your contributors are working on in a todo list or using blogging/social media give a potential contributor a good idea of what is in store with the core team. The fun part of being a contributor is to work out how to solve the difficult problems.</p>

<h2>Attracting Users</h2>

<p>The easiest way to attract users is to have a high quality product. Another important tool for attracting users is a vibrant, open collaborator community. </p>

<p>Regular releases are key. Users (rightly) see regular, on schedule releases as a sign of a healthy, mature project. Usually the first signs of a dying or dead project are the lack of regular updates, or delayed updates with no explanation.</p>

<p>Users expect communication from the contributor community. This communication is multi-pronged. Good bug reports are a key form of communication. Bugs should be &#8220;scrubbed&#8221; regularly looking for bugs which are show-stoppers and when a bug is fixed the &#8220;fix&#8221; and when it will be packaged should accompany every bug closing.</p>

<p>Other communication channels include the project&#8217;s documentation. Documentation is something which can lag behind very easily. Ideally the documentation for a project is auto-generated directly from the source code. If auto-generated documentation isn&#8217;t easy to do, then a documentation team should be part of the contributor group.</p>

<p>The project should also have a blog. This blog should entail interesting problems being faced, the current status, highlights of people who are working with/on the project. There should also be a planet for all the people who have an interest in your project to share their entries. To drum up traffic, the main blog could feature something from the user&#8217;s planet regularly.</p>

<p>Social media is another avenue for attracting users. Getting the news out on new releases, or other news items is easily done using the various social media sites.</p>

<p>Holding your meetings in a public place is another way of being transparent to your user community. Ideally these meetings would be in a medium such as IRC so there is automatically a transcript or log of the meeting minutes.</p>

<p>There should also be a status page where users can quickly get an idea where the project is with regards to its goals. Things to include here would be tasks needed to finish the next release, show stopper bugs/issues, automatic updates from the various tools used in the project, and any other information like that.</p>

<h2>In Closing</h2>

<p>A community is key to making an open source project work. Cultivating community should be the first priority of a project. A well groomed community spirit, will do more for a project than any technological advances or fancy tools any day. Remember the folks who would work on something need motivation. I for one would <a href="http://stormyscorner.com/would-you-do-it-again-for-free">do it again for free</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for step 1 and finally an official announcement of what this lead up is about.</p>

<p>The question posited is: "How does one rebuild RHEL in a timely, open and collaborative way?"</p>

<p>Well, a few of my UTOSC friends and I did a little brainstorming and came up with what we think a good bootstrapping infrastructure for just such a project would entail:</p>

        <h2>A good model</h2>

<p>A good example of how to run a distro is <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>. Their infrastructure team is very open and inclusive.  They do have a system which allows for automated timely builds as well.</p>

<p>Yes, the Fedora project does slip it's release dates, but when it does so there is good reason and things are done in a very open manner. A release date slipping because it's "not done yet" is one thing.  Helping your users understand what "not done yet" <em>*IS</em>, is a much more important part of managing a project.</p>

<h2>Bootstrapping</h2>

<p>A lot of these ideas come from observation of the Fedora Infrastructure team.</p>

<h3>Account management</h3>

<p>The Fedora Account system is central to the management of the Fedora Project.  It's a directory service which handles accounts and access to various infrastructure resources.</p>

<p>A good directory service should be the first thing a RHEL clone would need to bring up.</p>

<p>The most robust I'm aware of is <a href="http://freeipa.org/page/Main_Page">FreeIPA</a>.</p>

<h3>Build system</h3>

<p>Fedora uses <a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/">Koji</a> to manage the builds of their packages. This allows for a fully open and automate-able build of packages from an upstream vendor.  This is truly the key to a distro which needs to move fast.</p>

<p>There should also be a system in place for feedback of the packages in the distro. <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates">Bodhi</a> is a good tool for such a task.</p>

<h3>Public internet presence</h3>

<p>A distro also needs an internet presence, a way of managing content, interaction with users, interaction with developers and testers, and a means for wide communication. All of these tasks can be done pretty cheaply if not freely.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Github for source code related to the project (you could even use it as an issue tracker)</p></li>
<li><p>Google Groups for mailing lists -- mailing lists are a great way to manage a diverse group of help.</p></li>
<li><p>A public website is also needed to host www.$PROG.org and the project's documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>There should also be a downloads.$PROJ.org for hosting things such as isos, yum repos, etc. This should be available via FTP, RSYNC, and HTTP.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Semi-public internet presence</h3>

<p>In order for a distro like this to survive there needs to be multiple mirrors of the downloads server.  These would be primed via a mirror host which is restricted to everyone except a few first-level mirror sites.  The update of the mirrors would use rsync.</p>

<h3>Internal Infrastructure.</h3>

<p>There should also be an infrastructure host whose job it is to manage the other hosts mentioned.  This host would have no public-facing interfaces except SSH.  This host would act as the configuration management system's server, as well as the bastion host for the trusted infrastructure users to access and configure other servers. </p>

<p><strong>EVERYTHING</strong> would be configured using a configuration management system (puppet, chef, etc). This allows for the infrastructure team to quickly adjust for demand or utilization of resources.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>If such a project were to exist, the bootstrap resources needed would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Four servers minimum -- SuperMicro has a <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/system/2U/6026/SYS-6026TT-HIBQRF.cfm?INF=">4-node 2-RMU server</a></p></li>
<li><p>Some storage of some sort -- An inexpensive SAN solution would allow for the most flexibility. This <a href="http://www.coraid.com/products/sr821_8_disk_etherdrive_storage_appliance">Coraid Appliance</a> would be nice. </p></li>
<li><p>People interested in being open and willing to work in this endeavour.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This may be a pie-in-the-sky idea, but I think it has merit.  Can you think of anything missing from the above proposal?</p>

<p>Cheers <br />

<p>I always seem to keep busy, yes I know it never <em>seems</em> that way but I in fact keep pretty busy. Currently some of the things that keep me busy at home are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dog
<ul>
<li>Not only can the dog be a hoot, but a pest too! Of course it is a good thing when he comes and forcefully reminds me that he needs to go out. Forcefully reminding me to take a break can be good. Not sold on dragging me out for a milk bone though&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GoOSe Linux
<ul>
<li>GoOSe Linux is a project to rebuild a &#8220;major upstream&#8221; provider that is going fairly well. The process has been on going since May or June of this year and we have been making some good progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IPv6
<ul>
<li>IPv4 is gone&#8230; sort of&#8230; Any ways it is clearly going to be the wave of the future to use IPv6, not like BetaMax was the wave of the home video future either! I am at the point of actually working on rolling it out at home. Why? Fun and profit man! When clients go &#8220;Oh and can you talk about transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6?&#8221;, there is at least some demand. I suspect it is going to only increase. Transitions are only beginning.</li>
